# Frontend starter code

This contains the skeleton of a Next.js site (App Router) using TypeScript. You should build on this for the challenge.

We've included some useful NPM libraries in the `package.json` file. We recommend you use them; feel free to install other packages as needed.

You're free to use any UI framework you like. We recommend Chakra UI, Shadcn, Radix UI, or just Tailwind (with Headless UI, which we've pre-installed).

# Original Next.js documentation

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
